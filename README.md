# Naughts-X-Crosses

Author - Lachlan Stewart 2024

A variation on the game Naughts and Crosses in which when you go to place your 4th mark \(Of either X or O depending on your type\) then your oldest mark is removed, meaning you can only have 3 of your mark on the board at a time. This results in a longer and more strategical game.

Written in Python, it enables the user to play against another user on the same interface, to simulate a given number of games with random moves, and to recursively play a given number of games where all possible moves are attempted. There is a max game length in the settings which can be used to limit the length of a given game.
